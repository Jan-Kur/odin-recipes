            Paella is a classic Spanish rice dish cooked with saffron and a mix of seafood, chicken, or vegetables. 
            Known for its rich, smoky flavor and vibrant colors, it’s a hearty, one-pan meal often served right from the pan.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse the rice with cold water; drain; set aside. 
            Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to low, cover, and keep warm. 
            Work the garlic, parsley, curry powder, saffron threads, salt, black pepper, and 1/2 cup of the hot chicken stock together with a mortar and pestle until a smooth liquid forms; set the seasoning liquid aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a paella pan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion until lightly browned. 
            Stir in the chicken, shrimp, lobster, and clams; cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. 
            Pour in the seasoning liquid.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Stir in the rice, pour in the hot chicken stock, and simmer until the rice is nearly tender, about 15 minutes. 
            Add mushrooms, peas, and mussels; stir two times, and simmer for 10 minutes. 
            Remove from heat; cover and let stand until rice is soft and flaky, about 7 minutes.
